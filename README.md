# Python File Lister

This simple python script reads and renames all file names from a folder using a base name. (basename_1.txt, basename_2.txt etc.)

## Dependencies:
* [Python (Any version)](https://www.python.org/)

## Dependencies:

* Open `main.py` and edit the `folder_path` to the folder you want to get the file anmes out of.
* Edit the `base_name` to the desired name for all the files.
* Open the terminal inside the same folder where the `main.py` file is & run `python main.py`.
* ***(Optionally)*** Edit the `target_type` to a file type, to rename only a specific file type in that folder.
