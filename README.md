# Python File Renamer

This simple python script reads and renames all file names from a folder using a base name. It can target files with a specific extension or change the names of all files to the same base name regardless of their extension.

## Dependencies:
* [Python (Any version)](https://www.python.org/)

## Usage:

* Open `main.py`.
* Edit the variables to fit your needs:
  * `directory`: the directory containing the files you want to rename.
  * `base_name`: the base name of the files you want to rename.
  * `start_index`: the starting index for the new file names.
  * `target_extension` (optional): the file extension you want to target. If left as '', the script will rename all files regardless of their type.
* Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
* Run the script via 
```yaml
python main.py
```
